# 72h_projects
In this repository, we will keep track of the preprints produced during various editions of Complexity72h. It is mandatory to upload the .pdf report created within the 72-hour period. Additionally, we highly encourage you to include accompanying materials such as code, data, figures, and other resources to help reproduce the main results.
