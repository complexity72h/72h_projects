Mobile phone data are crucial to inform transportation planning and public health research. 
However, population level aggregated origin-destination (OD) matrices often hide inner 
differences reflecting socio-economic disparities and shaping health outcomes of epidemics 
in demographic groups. By crossing publicly available mobility datasets provided by the 
Spanish Ministry of Transportation with census records, here we approach tech adoption 
bias by studying the correlation among age, gender and income biases of mobile phone 
ownership in Spanish municipalities. By adjusting OD matrices by age and gender, we 
analyse socio-economic segregation levels in age groups and gendered respective networks 
and their differences with respect to the original dataset. The outcome of this study will 
shed new light on how the intersection of age, gender and income biases affects mobility 
flows estimates and provide new insights on the drivers of mobility segregation in the 
post-pandemic era.
