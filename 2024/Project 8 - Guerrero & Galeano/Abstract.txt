This project delves into the intricate dynamics of cancer, particularly focusing on 
glioblastoma, employing refined hybrid stochastic models with multiscale population 
dynamics. The research explores structured master equations at multiple scales, utilizing 
advanced techniques to analyze cellular population dynamics. Additionally, hybrid 
multiscale methods are proposed to efficiently model heterogeneous processes, particularly 
in tumor growth scenarios. The project also introduces a dynamical vertex model for cancer 
detection, incorporating a 2D cancer growth model and mechanical forces between cells. 
The model proves effective in capturing tissue abnormalities, with future plans to include 
diffusion for a comprehensive understanding of cancer dynamics. The validated models offer 
valuable insights into the mechanical forces governing tumor progression, advancing our 
comprehension of complex cancer processes.
