Food insecurity, defined as the lack of physical or economic access to safe, 
nutritious and sufficient food, remains one of the main challenges of the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development. Food insecurity is a complex phenomenon, 
resulting from the interplay of environmental, socio-demographic, and political 
events. Insightful qualitative work on the nexus between climate change, conflict, 
migration and food security was carried out during the last decade (Crush 2013; 
Martin-Shields and Stojetz 2019; Morales-Mu√±oz et al. 2020). However, quantitative 
analyses of the linkages among all these factors, and more specifically between 
migration networks and food security are still lacking. How do migration networks 
impact food access in receiving regions and, in return, how does food access impact 
the structure of migration networks (e.g. by changing flow sizes or inducing new 
migration routes)? How do migration networks co-evolve with food insecurity? In 
this project, we aim to address these questions using publicly available data provided 
by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the Food and Agriculture 
Organization.
