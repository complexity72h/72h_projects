This project aims to construct optimal railway networks by employing the novel 
modelling tool of tropical mathematics. Straightforward algorithms will be formulated 
and applied to abstractions of railway networks from cities around the world using 
freely available data of subway/railway network connections and travel times. For each 
network, we will formulate an algorithm that requires only a standard understanding of 
tropical mathematics, following which the optimisation steps are grounded solely in the 
study of circuits in the network. A fundamental theorem says that, in a strongly connected 
network such as the railway, the eigenvalue in this system is unique and determined by 
the circuit(s) with the largest average weight. Thus, critical circuits in the network are 
those circuits that comprise the longest average round-trip time, which also represents 
average inter-departure times. Reducing the eigenvalue therefore addresses the aim of 
maximising the frequency of departures; our algorithm achieves this by identifying such 
circuits and incrementally adding dummy stations on them. Subsequently, new critical circuits 
are identified, and the process is repeated until desired. Thus, we strategically add nodes 
and edges, enlarging circuits along the way so as to reduce the eigenvalue.  Ultimately, this 
produces a new network layout as optimal. We will subsequently analyse the practicality and 
commonalities of these optimal railway networks.  If time permits, we will look at an extension 
of this model, which will allow us to explore fresh insights into network science areas such 
as threshold dynamics, network backbones, and the structure-dynamics interplay.
