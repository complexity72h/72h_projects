In early 2020, there was widespread adoption of public health measures to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, 
including stay-at-home orders, gathering restrictions, school and business closures, and travel bans. 
These interventions were effective at reducing not only SARS-CoV-2 transmission but also the spread of 
other respiratory pathogens, with many endemic respiratory viruses not returning to widespread circulation 
until the end of 2020 or 2021. Aggregated location data from cell phones have been used extensively to 
model SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, but few studies have explored relationships between human mobility and the 
transmission of endemic respiratory pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this project, we will 
use uniquely detailed data from a citywide respiratory pathogen surveillance study, in combination 
with mobile device location data, to investigate the impacts of mobility behavior on endemic pathogen 
rebound during the pandemic in Seattle, Washington. First, we will perform an in-depth analysis of 
temporal changes in Seattleâ€™s mobility network during the pandemic, using weekly data on between-neighborhood 
movement. Next, we will use mechanistic mathematical models of transmission to explore how changes in case 
importations and within-city connectivity affected the timing and size of rebound for endemic viruses with 
different biological characteristics (e.g., rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, seasonal coronaviruses). 
Contact rates and seeding will be informed by mobility data, and epidemic trajectories produced by models 
will be compared to observed pathogen incidences from Seattle Flu Alliance surveillance data. These two 
exercises will introduce participants to network analysis and infectious disease compartmental models.
