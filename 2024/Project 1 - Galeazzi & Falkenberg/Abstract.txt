Online social networks increasingly mediate how billions of people worldwide consume and share content. 
This content can often be political in nature, playing a key role in driving political polarization, 
the creation and spread of misinformation, and the formation of online echo chambers. However, the 
opinions of online social media users are often difficult to measure directly, therefore their opinions 
must often be inferred indirectly. Arguably, the greatest impediment to accurately measuring online 
opinions is the lack of user level data, or data which has been pre-filtered and does not fairly reflect 
an individual’s social media use. With new restrictions on academic data access having come into place in 
2023, a key open question is “what is the minimum amount of data needed about an individual to infer their 
opinions, and to what extent can social networks be used to reconstruct this information?” To address this 
question, our project will infer users’ opinions on social media using partial data and network reconstruction 
methods. Using existing social media data, our study will start from opinion inference techniques which use 
complete interaction data and aims to extend these methods for use with partial data and indirect interactions. 
Our project will be primarily computational, but also offers opportunities for users to develop and implement 
opinion dynamics models if the students are interested. With this approach, we hope to develop measures which 
are able to predict a user’s ideological leaning in different contexts using minimal datasets.
