This project delves into the complex domain of the human intra-urban mobility modeling, in particular 
in the trajectories reconstruction from GPS data with potentially large and varied sampling rate 
along with spatial and temporal gaps. The main goal of the project is to create a mobility model 
capable of reconstructing and predicting the intra-urban mobility patterns of a designated device, 
especially in scenarios with compromised data quality. To address this challenge, two anonymised 
mobility data samples will be released for a specific number of users, a specific time period and 
a well-defined urban area. The first sample, serving as a high-quality ground truth, will distinctly 
delineate the trajectories of individual users. The second sample, on the other hand, will be a modified 
version of it, designed by introducing noise and resampling to simulate real-world spatial and sampling 
irregularities. These datasets will be complemented by the corresponding road network extracted from 
OpenStreetMap. The team’s mission is to develop a methodology capable of reconstructing accurate 
trajectories from the corrupted subsample. At the same time, the team must provide metrics that 
facilitate the evaluation of the precision and accuracy of the results against the established 
ground truth. The entire process will take place within Cuebiq’s Spectus platform, which provides 
access to the data and computational capabilities required for effective development and analysis. 
In conclusion, the project enables the exploration of real-world mobility data and the interesting 
challenge of mobility trajectory reconstruction, all by exploiting the advanced capabilities of the 
Spectus platform.
