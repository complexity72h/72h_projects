This project focuses on deciphering the drivers of social interactions through a 
comprehensive analysis of longitudinal data supplemented by metadata. The project 
builds on top of recent research outputs on the social dynamics of link and group 
formation extracted from temporally-resolved empirical proximity data. In particular, 
by linking both individual and external factors (as well as environmental constraints) 
to the dynamical behavior of a temporal social network, the study aims to study the 
patterns of initiation, maintenance, evolution, and transformation of both interpersonal 
bonds and group affiliations. The investigation will extend beyond pairwise interactions 
to also include group dynamics. The project will rely on two independent data collection 
experiments that include both human interactions and individual metadata (age, language, 
declared attractiveness, socio-economic features, family education, etc.), bringing 
valuable insights for social and network scientists.
